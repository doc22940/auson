I bet you felt my\ninsecurity before I ordered and I loved it when you came over to guide me. I was\nstill unsure when I ordered though! But what resulted was amazing and thank you\nfor opening my taste buds and horizons :) Even though Starbucks wasn't really\ncomfortable for my large ass laptop, and the lack of a second monitor made my\nplanned work un-doable, the view I had made everything worth it. The emotions I\nfeel when I look up and see the face of someone I have such strong feelings for\nis irreplaceable. During lunch, my eye was opened once again with some real\ntruffle! And it was really funny to see you forget to take a picture opps ðŸ™ˆ I\nreally loved our subsequent study session at the Esplanade and while I had to\nparticipate in a group meeting, you were very sweet and accompanied me\ndownstairs so you could be with me. Sorry that you you got rashes from the seats\n:'( Once again, dinner was planned by you and while the sides (and popcorn) was\nmeh, the main course was definitely the best beef I've eaten in my life. I can't\nwait for more dates with you. And hopefully I can come up with some amazing\nplans as you always do. I love you :)</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 501px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/bee3e7e79aa06cef1d7681478effe214/55811/bagel.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 27.500000000000004%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAGCAYAAADDl76dAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAABH0lEQVQY042OTU+DQBCG+fFGjV6MHu0/8eTZk4nlYykUSrVsP6DCboGW8rhgaOLNSd6d3Z2Z5x1rMnnm6fGBuoUk05RxRPn6QrNc8N84nY5UVUXTNFh3t/fcXF2TSok3C4mDgMSx+YzmLJIFURQRxzHRfI6Ua5aLiPQrJkkS8nxPZ4Dn85m2bYdsjS4yXWHbU/xZQGAgQniEBuIJget5uMbEdjyE+07sv+G4gsCY13XzZ1urpw5AmZoBB9d1EAYwnX78wsMQ3/eNgcAx9fVmS77/ZrvbUZblMNt13UVWf/RxOBzQRn2TUgqtFUVRoLQ2W9RDvTT/Y/8Y43vMF2Cha9Z7TVZWrLKSXVGRqwpp/jZGaaYGyVxxPLU94Q9svP8AXFLESWBiUAEAAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"bagel\"\n        title=\"bagel\"\n        src=\"/static/bee3e7e79aa06cef1d7681478effe214/55811/bagel.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/bee3e7e79aa06cef1d7681478effe214/772e8/bagel.png 200w,\n/static/bee3e7e79aa06cef1d7681478effe214/e17e5/bagel.png 400w,\n/static/bee3e7e79aa06cef1d7681478effe214/55811/bagel.png 501w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The best \"bread\" ever","by":"Nelson"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/letters/the-best-bread-ever/"}}}
