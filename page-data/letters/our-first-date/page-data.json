Pro\ntip: It is never a good idea to go for axe throwing on your first date. You\ncan't really converse with the potential love of your life (who is now the love\nof my life), and in all honesty it wasn't really that fun. Next time maybe you\ncan consider the zoo as she hinted ðŸ™ˆ (well there is not gonna be a next time\nfor any of us anyways eh) I was a lucky guy to chance upon the Thai style pasar\nmalam thingy, and probably made one of the best decisions in my life when I\ndecided to put aside my bias for claw machines and put that note into the\nmachine. It never dawned on me till much later that the experience mattered so\nto you and I am glad that you found me as someone you could trust. Dinner was\nfine, it was nothing to write home about as compared to all the other places\nyou've brought me to. The subsequent dessert bar was mind blowing though, and I\nam glad that you enjoyed the experience. I did very much enjoy our date. It was\nwhen we were playing the claw machine and you grabbing me by the arms that I\nstarted falling in love with you. While I may have looked sheepish when you did\nthat, I definitely appreciated your receptiveness to me. It was inappropriate\nfor me say say \"I love you\" then, but now that we are on the same page, I would\nlike to do exactly that. I love you my dear Audrey! (Low key regretting that I\ndid not take any photos to upload here. So you are just stuck with this GIF\n[pronounced \"gift\"] of my silly smile hehe)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/Ve0TcSvdh6jgKCl81D/200w_d.gif\" alt=\"2am\">\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 202px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/ffe4e95266b473e61ebb9ed5228a2429/94f90/claw-machine.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 133.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"claw machine\"\n        title=\"claw machine\"\n        src=\"/static/ffe4e95266b473e61ebb9ed5228a2429/94f90/claw-machine.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ffe4e95266b473e61ebb9ed5228a2429/e07e9/claw-machine.jpg 200w,\n/static/ffe4e95266b473e61ebb9ed5228a2429/94f90/claw-machine.jpg 202w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 202px) 100vw, 202px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 600px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/e4e5df9c2403489860ec04e455a9db85/b4294/axe-factor.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 90.49999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"axe factor\"\n        title=\"axe factor\"\n        src=\"/static/e4e5df9c2403489860ec04e455a9db85/b4294/axe-factor.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/e4e5df9c2403489860ec04e455a9db85/e07e9/axe-factor.jpg 200w,\n/static/e4e5df9c2403489860ec04e455a9db85/066f9/axe-factor.jpg 400w,\n/static/e4e5df9c2403489860ec04e455a9db85/b4294/axe-factor.jpg 600w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Our first date","by":"Nelson"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/letters/our-first-date/"}}}
