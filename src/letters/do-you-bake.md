We matched while I was swiping in the midst of work. When I sent that message, I
didn't expect much. What attracted me was that you were passionate in
programming, and I felt that we could connect well in that aspect. In the
ensuing month + weeks, connect well did we. While we may not have known each
other for long, the ensuing journey was something neither of us expected. Over
here, some of our notable dates are listed and they contain my memories when the
event happened. I hope that we do continue filling this site up day by day
together, until we have a scrapbook of memories.
