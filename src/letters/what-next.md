This site was kinda rushed so it is definitely not my proudest work in the
technical aspect. Code is messy and I don't understand all of it LOL. I planned
to present this to you on the day circuit breaker was supposed to end (I kinda
felt they would extend it), but I know how you are feeling now so I hope this
helps for a bit! What I have in mind is that we slowly update this website
together and add more dates we are going to have in the future here! And I will
be leaving you letters for the days I will be busy at work here too and you can
read them when you miss me too much. I will miss you a lot too and I am thankful
that you understand my plight. I love you and I will figure out how to extend
this site in the future and we can use it to store all the memories we share!
Click the button for a surprise!
