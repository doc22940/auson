Thank you for calling me your favorite person :) You are my favorite person too
and I will love you forever <3 This was the day I tried out the best fish in my
life, and it was all thanks to my darling for giving me the courage to take that
leap of faith. Yes, there were many things on the table that I was really
apprehensive of trying, and you gave me that additional push and I've regretted
nothing. The quick "dinner" we had outside the MRT station before we went home
was weirdly romantic, and at Bukit Panjang, I was low key happy that the bus was
going to take 20+ minutes to arrive. I treasure every moment I spend with my
love and I am glad that I could spend more time with you that night. And yes,
thank you for staying up late to filter out the choices to a few that I would
like. That was really a lot of effort and I appreciate it. Love you to the moon
and back and some more :)
