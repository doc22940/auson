When you said you were going for a grocery run at Buona Vista, my first instinct
was to ask if I could follow along. I was afraid that you would say no, so thank
you for accepting my gesture! I love it when you appreciate my love! I really
loved it when you shared so much about your interests with me. I love that glow
in your eyes whenever you share something interesting with me. While we did have
issues choosing where to go for dinner, in the end you made a great choice again
and we got to enjoy something we were both familiar with! Sorry for being so bad
at making decisions, I will do better okie :) And yes I am looking forward to
the cooking class date we gonna have together in the future!
